# Microservice Architecture

## Scope

Create a comprehensive decomposition and microservices approach to building your complex application.  Topcoder will begin with one of our standard templates and then run an architecture challenge to decompose your system into a series of challenges.  Afterwards we will build all services in a parallel approach.

# Bug Hunt

## Scope

The Topcoder community will scour your application to find bugs and holes in your application.  The community is incented to try a variety of different browsers and devices but we do not explicitly test different scenarios.  This is not a replacement for a standard QA cycle but a great supplemental offering to traditional QA services.

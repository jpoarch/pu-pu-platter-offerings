# Single Round Matches (SRMs) / Real Time Algorithm Development Competitions
## Scope

Coding as a spectator sport was created by Topcoder when we first launched Single Round Matches in 2001. These matches are as fun as it can get and feature potentially thousands of coders going head to head split into two divisions of top tier developers.  Three problems, easy, mediuam and hard, are presented to the developers who have a heart racing 90 minutes to solve all three problems to their best of their abilities.  Following coding and an intermission, developers then feversly pour over each other's code to find flaws and launch challenges to break each others code.  Lastly, all participants solutions are run against our thousands of test cases as part of system tests.  All passing solutions are then scored and the winners are declared.

We provide two ways for companies to get involved in these exciting events.  The first is sponsorship which allows companies to sponsor these challenges:
- sponsor virtual single round matches
- sponsor a local event (stand alone event like a college tour)
- sponsor regional event as part of the TCO
- sponsor the TCO finals

##### BOLD DO WE WANT TO DO THIS

The last option is to run a private internal SRM (either virtually or in person)

# Componenet / Service Re-use catalog

## Scope

Do you have a set of reusable components or services you need updated  or maybe even completely rewritten when new releases of frameworks are available?  The Topcoder community will maintain your catalog of components and can even customize the components on demand for your clients. This will also facilitate application development on top of these assets (improved efficiency).  

If the community is maintaining / creating your reuse catalog, Topcoder expects a 20% reduction in costs and timelines to implementing applications based on these tools since they will be intimately familiar with the code base.
